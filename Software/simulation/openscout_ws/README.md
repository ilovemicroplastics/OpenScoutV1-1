This is a ROS2 package for virtually simulating the OpenScoutV1.1 robot.

## Environment
[Ubuntu Noble 24.04.1](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/) 

[ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html)

[Gazebo Harmonic](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/ros_installation/)
 
### Further info
During the time of writing (2025), Gazebo Harmonic does not tolerate running in a virtual machine very well. It is recommended to run it on a computer with Ubuntu Noble installed natively. 

Additionally, when installing Gazebo Harmonic ensure that you do not install the standalone version. Instead first install ROS2 Jazzy, and then opt for [the version of Gazebo integrated into ROS2 Jazzy.](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/ros_installation/)

## Guide to running the package (On the default Ubuntu system)

First prepare the environment, as listed above.

Download or clone the repository openscout_ws, and put it in the **home** folder.

Open the Terminal and enter the following commands.

````
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
cd ~/openscout_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch openscout openscout.launch.py
````

This should open the simulation.

From there you can try moving the openscout with teleop keyboard.
In a new terminal enter the following:
````
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
````

If you don't have the teleop_twist_keyboard package installed, then install it.
````
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
sudo apt-get install ros-jazzy-teleop-twist-keyboard
````

## Once in the simulation

Try driving over the slope with one side. This showcases the joint in the middle of the robot.

Feel free to make edits to the SDF to test whatever you like.

Its possible to make a python file to control the openscout using ROS2 topics.

As can be seen, the simulated OpenScoutV1.1 is a close approximation. Unfortunately due to Gazebo Harmonic (01/04/25) physics limitations, modelling the interaction between wheels and the ground realistically is difficult. An idea being floated is to try to port the [Gazebo Classic wheel slip plugin](https://github.com/gazebosim/gazebo-classic/blob/gazebo11/plugins/WheelSlipPlugin.hh) to Gazebo Harmonic. In theory this would resolve the software bottleneck, but it would require extensive development and testing. Another idea is to use Gazebo Classic, however it is EoL and would require porting the current setup down to it.

Notes - It's not perfect but considering that the simulation was created from scratch is a great success.
