# Wheel
The wheel, and the parts connecting it to the axel (Hex coupler, Hex Wheel driver) are either produced by third parties or out of production. This is a critical shortage which prevents anyone who doesn't already own these parts from building the OpenScoutV1.1. As such, they have to be replaced. Rather than finding a new commerical part, it is highly recommended to find a design or to design a wheel which can be produced locally with low or little skill. 3D printing comes to mind as it's a good way to make a part which can be reproduced forever, but if a better wheel solution is found so be it. Maybe it's easier to make the wheel out of cut acrylic? Ultimately it comes down to what works in practice and thats hard to predict.

Notes - I can't do this fully due to practical limitations, but I recommend this page be used to detail what each part is exactly with pictures and blueprints, just in case links to buy them go offline. This could also be a place to store notes about plans of how each part is going to be replaced to increase the ability to build the robot locally.
