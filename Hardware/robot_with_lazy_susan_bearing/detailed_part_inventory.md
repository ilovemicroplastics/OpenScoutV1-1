The wheel, and the parts connecting it to the axel (Hex coupler, Hex Wheel driver) are either produced by third parties or out of production. This is a critical shortage which prevents anyone who doesn't already own these parts from building the OpenScoutV1.1. As such, they have to be replaced. Rather than finding a new commerical part, it is highly recommended to find a design or to design a wheel which can be produced locally with low or little skill. 3D printing comes to mind as it's a good way to make a part which can be reproduced forever, but if a better wheel solution is found so be it. Maybe it's easier to make the wheel out of cut acrylic? Ultimately it comes down to what works in practice and thats hard to predict.


# Hinge

The hinge isn't technically out of stock, but it's availablity has been spotty. It seems to be available on aliexpress but western online stores can be hit or miss. This hinge comes in multiple size variants, although 5.5in is used for the OpenScoutV1.1. Occasionally stores will refer to it as a "Lazy Susan". If this particular design does come out of production it should be easy to replace it as there are many similar hinges online, its just that the CAD files for the plastic plates where the hinge meets would need to be redesigned to fit the new screw locations. This would work, but once again it's not a permanent solution. The ideal solution would be reproducible locally forever, admittedly that's difficult with a hinge but maybe there is a solution.

Notes - I can't do this fully due to practical limitations, but I recommend this page be used to detail what each part is exactly with pictures and blueprints, just in case links to buy them go offline. This could also be a place to store notes about plans of how each part is going to be replaced to increase the ability to build the robot locally.
