Notes - It's a bit barren but I can't do much about this right now. If significant changes are made do make sure to update the videos here. If you don't know how to make these links, its very bizzare, you put a video into a new issue and you copy the link that gets created. That link won't die it will keep showing the video even if you don't submit the issue.
